# Privacy Policy
Last updated: March 29, 2021

# Consent
By using this app, you consent to our privacy policy.

# What data is collected?
We collect data the minimum amount of data necessary to make the app function as
expected.

This includes:
1. Latest approximate location of the device
2. Alert preferences
3. App instance token
4. A history of what alerts were sent

The data collected is completely anonymous, only linked to the app instance
token so we know what device to send alerts to.

# Usage of your data
Your data will not be used for any other purpose than providing and improving
this service.

# Disclosure of your personal data
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties. Under certain
circumstances, we may be required to disclose data if required to do so by law
or in response to valid requests by public authorities.

# How long is this data kept?
Upon uninstalling the app, the token used to identify the app instance will
expire after one hour. All data is guaranteed to be permanently deleted by the
next time an alert would have been sent to your device.

We do not keep a history of the device's location. The latest location will
override any previous ones.

# Security
The security of your personal data is important to us, but remember that no
method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100%
secure. We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of
your personal information. We also deliberately reduce the accuracy of location
data to the approximate area needed for alerts. While we do our best to protect
your personal data, we cannot grantee its absolute security.

# Changes to this privacy policy
We may update this policy from time to time. You are advised to review this
privacy policy periodically for any changes. Changes are dated at the top and
are effective immediately after being posted to this page.

# Transparency
Both the front end and back end source code are public. If you have any doubts,
check out our GitHub repositories.
